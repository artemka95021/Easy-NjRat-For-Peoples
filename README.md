# Easy-NjRat-For-Peoples
This is a guide on how to make njRAT without a white IP and an open port.
1. We need to unzip all the files
2. Go to the ngrok website and log in to your account
3. Open the command prompt in the folder with ngrok.exe and we write a command to log in to ngrok itself
4. Open njRAT and ngrok
5. In ngrok we drive such a comand "ngrok tcp 8657"
6. After entering the command in njRAT, click on the "Builder" button and drive the IP and port to the host
example: "Host: 5.tcp.eu.ngrok.io
Port: 18068"
7. you create a build, disguise it under any program or installer
Everything is ready!

The file "Hibernation mode.bat" is needed to turn off the computer and for all programs to remain on
